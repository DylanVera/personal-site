Unity's built in physics system is meant to simulate realistic kinematics so our team implemented our own raycast based physics system to give the game the feeling of a super fast old school platformer. The demo has two singleplayer levels available as well as a WIP local multiplayer mode. Keyboard and Gamepad controls supported. Art assets thanks to CC0.",
